    <h2>What have The Strength Yard been doing to mitigate the health risk?</h2>
    </h2>
    <div>
      <p>We are closely monitoring the situation and will adjust our responses in line with any ministry guidelines.<br> If there are any changes, we will post it to our social media pages as well as via email.<br> Therefore, please check in every
        now and then to keep yourself up to date.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, we have:</p>
      <p>1. Stepped up the frequency of our cleaning/disinfecting of gym equipment.</p>
      <p>2. Placed disinfectant sprays and paper towels at both levels for our members to wipe down the gym equipment before and after use.</p>
      <p>3. Placed hand sanitizers at strategic locations for our members and staff to use.</p>
      <p>4. Implemented temperature checks as well as health declaration for our members when they enter the gym.</p>
      <p>5. Suspending all casual passes/walk in services, only members are allowed into the gym with a card access.</p>
      <p>6. Implemented a booking system to restrict capacity of the gym.</p>
      <p>7. Reduced the max capacity of our Progressive Strength Classes to 5 Pax (Not inclusive of coaches or staff) with 2 meters safety distancing (2 arms-length) safety distancing in place.</p>
      <p>8. Limiting Open Gym capacity to 8 pax per hour (Not inclusive of coaches or staff) with 2 meters safety distancing (2 arms-length) in place and a max training duration of 2 hours.</p>
      <p>9. Ensure all staff are to wear a mask during their shifts.</p>

    <h2>What can you do to help?</h2>
      <div>
        <p>We all have a part to play in order to keep the gym safe for all of us.<br> In addition to our added preventive measures, we seek your cooperation in the following:</p>
        <p>1. Remember to take your temperature and clock in your details at the booth upon entry</p>
        <p>2. Sanitize upon entering the gym and before you leave. We have sanitizers located at the front of the gym at the temperature booth as well as at the counter behind.</p>
        <p>3. Do not show up at the gym if you are having a fever (Above 38 Degrees Celsius) or exhibit visible symptoms such as coughing, sneezing, breathlessness or runny nose.</p>
        <p>4. Disinfect the gym equipment and wipe them down with the paper towels provided before and after use. Please dispose the towels in the bin immediately after.</p>
        <p>5. Make a booking through the booking system before heading down.</p>
        <p>6. Adhere to the 8 pax per hour (Not inclusive of coaches or staff) capacity limit and 2 meters (2 arms-length) safety distancing in place with a max training duration of 2 hours for Open Gym.</p>
        <p>7. Adhere to the max capacity of 5 Pax (Not inclusive of coaches or staff) with 2 meters safety distancing (2 arms-length) safety distancing in place for our Progressive Strength Classes .</p>
        <p>8. Minimise socialising while in the gym.</p>
        <p>9. Bring your own towel.</p>
        <p>10. It is recommended to wear a mask while in the gym but can be taken off during strenuous activity.</p>
